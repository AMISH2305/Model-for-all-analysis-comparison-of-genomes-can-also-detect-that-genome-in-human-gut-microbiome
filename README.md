This model is a one stop solution for all researchers who want to analyze and pin point genomes
You can give two genomes to the model , the model will analaze each one of them and give the results
Then the model will compare both the genomes and give the results
After that, The model will train itself from the ORFs of genome and then will try to pin point them in Human Gut microbiome
